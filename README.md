# Nearest Smaller Values
Advanced Data Structures Project: Using cartesian tree to solve all nearest smaller values problem

Input data is in the data.txt file and seperated by ' ,' (one whitespace and a comma)

Output Example:
'''
Array:  [0, 8, 4, 12, 2, 10, 6, 14, 1, 9, 5, 13, 3, 11, 7, 15]
Nearest Left Smaller Values:  - 0 0 4 0 2 2 6 0 1 1 5 1 3 3 7 
Nearest Right Smaller Values: - 4 2 2 1 6 1 1 - 5 3 3 - 7 - -
